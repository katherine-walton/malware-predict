# Malware Prediction

## Problem
Microsoft takes the issue of malware very seriously. As a company with over one billion users, Microsoft needs innovative ways to fight the ever-evolving barrage of malware attacks on consumers. In order to combat this threat, Microsoft wants to calculate the probability of their Windows machines being infected with malware.

## Data
Each unique machine is one of almost eight million records in the data set that stores approximately 80 features, including its processor, engine version, and location. The features are mainly categorical, with some continuous. The target, or y-value, to predict is HasDetections, which is a float value between 0 and 1, representing the probability. According to Microsoft, the data provided has been collected to satisfy business requirements, which could mean that some data is left out.

## Preprocessing
Preprocessing techniques that we used include removing columns that were sparsely populated with data, had a high correlation with other features, or whose values remained nearly constant. For certain columns, we are choosing to impute data instead of removing the feature. In addition to these methods, we used one-hot encoding so our data would be compatible with '''sklearn'''. 

## Methods
In order to solve this problem, we are implementing a range of models: Random Forest, XGBoost, and others. We evaluate the models based on the AUC curve. A benchmark we are hoping to cross is an AUC score of at least 0.65.
