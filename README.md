#Malware Prediction
##Problem
Microsoft takes the issue of malware very seriously. As a company with over one billion users, Microsoft needs innovative ways to fight the ever-evolving barrage of malware attacks on consumers. In order to combat this threat, Microsoft wants to calculate the probability of their Windows machines being infected with malware.

##Data
Each unique machine is one of almost eight million records in the data set that stores approximately 80 features, including its processor, engine version, and location. The features are mainly categorical, with some continuous. The target, or y-value, to predict is HasDetections, which is a float value between 0 and 1, representing the probability. According to Microsoft, the data provided has been collected to satisfy business requirements, which could mean that some data is left out.

##Methods
In order to solve this problem, we are implementing a range of models: Random Forest, XGBoost, and others.
